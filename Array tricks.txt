there is print and println these are different in sout 
as print will print there and cursor will be in same line where as in println in next line

ArrayList<Integer> list=new ArrayList<>(); //////is the syntax for the array list
Here we use Integer and not int as int is primitive data type we use wrapper class here
.add(value)
.contains(value)
.set(index,value)
.remove(index)
.get(index)
List[index] will not work like arr[i] use get

internally arraylist size is fixed
1.half filled
2.new list created arraylist of double size
3.copy form there to next
4.delete before

can create multi dimenstion array add arraylist
check in the arraylist part 

reverse done by swap s and end
